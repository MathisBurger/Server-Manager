# Server-Manager
This is the rewrite of one of my old projects.
I rewrote it in go, because go is my favourite language.
Furthermore the new version contains websockets for continuous communication with the backend.


## Disclaimer
This is only an fun project. It is not made for the use in production.
I used it for growing my experience with golang
